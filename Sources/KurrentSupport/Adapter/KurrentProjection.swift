/// Phase 1 of the KurrentDB read-side projection runner.
///
/// `PersistentSubscriptionRunner` subscribes to a KurrentDB persistent subscription
/// and dispatches each incoming event to one or more registered projectors in parallel.
/// Replaces the per-handler `start() { Task { ... } }` boilerplate found in application
/// projection handlers.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let runner = KurrentProjection.PersistentSubscriptionRunner(
///     client: kdbClient,
///     stream: "$ce-Order",
///     groupName: "order-projection"
/// )
/// .register(orderProjector) { record in
///     OrderProjectorInput(orderId: extractId(from: record))
/// }
///
/// try await runner.run()  // Blocks until cancelled or subscription drops.
/// ```
///
/// ## Idempotency contract
///
/// Registered projectors must be idempotent. The runner nacks the entire event on any
/// projector failure, causing KurrentDB to re-deliver the event. Already-successful
/// projectors will be invoked again on re-delivery.
///
/// `StatefulEventSourcingProjector` satisfies this contract automatically via its stored
/// revision cursor (re-invocations become no-ops). Users of the low-level closure overload
/// must ensure their `execute` closure is idempotent.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// - `run()` blocks until the parent `Task` is cancelled (returns normally) or the
///   subscription connection drops (throws).
/// - The runner does not auto-reconnect — the caller is responsible for re-running it
///   on failure (typically via Swift Service Lifecycle's `ServiceGroup`).
///
/// ## System projection streams
///
/// When subscribing to a system projection stream like `$ce-<Category>` or `$et-<Type>`,
/// you must create the persistent subscription with `resolveLink = true`. Otherwise the
/// `RecordedEvent` delivered to your `extractInput` closure will reference the system
/// stream itself (e.g., `$ce-Order`) rather than the original aggregate stream
/// (e.g., `Order-<id>`). This is a KurrentDB requirement, not enforced by the runner.
///
/// ```swift
/// try await client.persistentSubscriptions(stream: "$ce-Order", group: "...")
///     .create { options in
///         options.settings.resolveLink = true
///     }
/// ```
///
/// ## Phase 2 (deferred)
///
/// Cross-projector transactional rollback (Postgres-shared transaction) is deferred to
/// Phase 2. Phase 1 provides at-least-once delivery + projector-level idempotency only.
