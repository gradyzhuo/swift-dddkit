//  TransactionalReadModelStore.swift
//  ReadModelPersistence
//
//  Read model store that performs writes scoped to a caller-supplied transaction.
//  Mirror of `ReadModelStore` with explicit `in transaction:` parameter.
//  Companion to `EventSourcing.TransactionProvider`.
//
//  Used by `KurrentProjection.TransactionalSubscriptionRunner` to ensure all
//  projectors' reads/writes for a single event participate in one shared
//  transaction (all-or-nothing).
//
//  See spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-transactional-subscription-runner-design.md
